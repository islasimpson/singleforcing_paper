Analysis codes for reproducing the figures in the CESM2 single forcing large ensemble description paper.

The single forcing large ensemble data can be downloaded from NCAR's climate data gateway.  See the information here: https://www.cesm.ucar.edu/working-groups/climate/simulations/cesm2-single-forcing-le

The ./DATA\_SORT sub-directory, contains processing scripts that are used to generate processed data that are then used by the python notebooks to make the figures for the paper, located in the ./figures sub-directory.
